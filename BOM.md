# Bill of Materials (BoM)

> ⚠️ **Work in progress / draft.** This is an evolving sketch, not a final BoM.
> View rationale in [docs/design-document.md](docs/design-document.md).

**First working BoM** is targeted for **mid-July '26**

**A final, fully-costed BoM** is targeted for **end of August '26**

Blog post - how I'm making this BOM [How-to: Source BOM for OOMWOO Open-Source Vacuum Robot](https://makerspet.com/blog/how-to-source-bom-for-oomwoo-open-source-vacuum-robot/)

---

## Budget target

**~$200 in sourced parts + a Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB)**, aiming at the capability of a
mid-range ($500–600) commercial vacuum. Mopping and premium obstacle detection (ToF +
color camera + an NPU accelerator) push toward / past the top of that range; premium
vision is a clearly-priced **add-on**, not part of the base figure.

> **⚠️ Fan sourcing caveat:** the **kPa is the fan's own rating** — verify it against the fan's
> model number / datasheet. The vacuum models are a **sourcing search aid only**: a fan listed
> as "fits vacuum X" is *not* necessarily X's original fan (lower-power replacements are sold as
> compatible for higher-suction models). Omit any model whose known suction contradicts the row.

## Dock (by tier)

Three dock tiers share one robot base, released in order:

| Tier | Adds | Rough extra parts |
|---|---|---|
| **Basic charge** (first release) | charging only | printed housing + contacts/magnets + wall adapter + IR beacon |
| **Auto-empty** | dust auto-emptying | dock fan + bin/bag + sealed port |
| **Auto-empty + wash + dry** | mop wash + hot-air dry | clean + dirty tanks, 2 pumps, heater + fan, **own ESP32 + WiFi controller** |

## Sourcing strategy

- **Print geometry, source mechanisms and wear items.** See the print-vs-source table in
  [docs/design-document.md](docs/design-document.md#2-print-vs-source-strategy).
- Spec wear parts (brushes, filters, wheel modules) in **common, abundant sizes** so
  builders can buy cheap universal replacements anywhere.
- Per-module sourcing details will land in the relevant
  [contributions/](contributions) RFCs as they mature.
